---- MODULE PyreflyFixpoint ----

\* Iterative fixpoint SCC solver.
\*
\* This models Pyrefly's SCC solving algorithm. The solver runs a fixed
\* number of iterations (MaxPhase) rather than checking for convergence.
\*
\* Convergence detection is omitted intentionally: in Pyrefly, the
\* iteration count is bounded (e.g., max 5). Convergence is just an
\* optimization that allows early exit when answers stabilize. Since
\* some SCCs genuinely don't converge, the algorithm must be correct
\* without it. This model verifies correctness properties under the
\* fixed-iteration protocol.
\*
\* Dynamic dependency visibility is provided by DynamicGraph operators.
\* The raw generated schedule is wrapped by Deps/DynamicDeps and the
\* per-node push counter is updated via RecordPush on each stack push.
\*
\* See DESIGN.md for the full design rationale.

EXTENDS Sequences, FiniteSets, Naturals, DynamicGraph

\*
\* scc_anchors_read tracks, for each node, which SCC segment-bottom
\* values it has read preliminary answers from. Used to verify
\* invariant (a): no cross-SCC preliminary answer leakage.

\* Helpers
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------

\* Number of fixpoint phases after discovery; tied to dynamic schedule horizon.
MaxPhase == StepCount - 1

\* The set of all nodes currently on the stack.
StackSet == {stack[i] : i \in 1..Len(stack)}

\* Find the position of node n in the stack (1-indexed from bottom).
\* Returns 0 if not found.
StackPos(n) ==
    IF \E i \in 1..Len(stack) : stack[i] = n
    THEN CHOOSE i \in 1..Len(stack) : stack[i] = n
    ELSE 0

\* The set of nodes on the stack from position pos through top.
StackSlice(pos) ==
    {stack[i] : i \in pos..Len(stack)}

\* Which SCC (by index in scc_stack) does node n belong to?
\* Returns 0 if n is not in any SCC.
SccOf(n) ==
    IF \E i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) : n \in scc_stack[i].members
    THEN CHOOSE i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) : n \in scc_stack[i].members
    ELSE 0

\* Is node n in any SCC?
InAnyScc(n) ==
    \E i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) : n \in scc_stack[i].members

\* Look up a node's SCC-local state.
\* Returns "NoScc" if the node is not in any SCC.
SccState(n) ==
    LET i == SccOf(n)
    IN  IF i = 0 THEN "NoScc"
        ELSE scc_stack[i].node_state[n]

\* The phase of the SCC containing node n, or 0 if not in any SCC.
SccPhase(n) ==
    LET i == SccOf(n)
    IN  IF i = 0 THEN 0
        ELSE scc_stack[i].phase

\* The dependency edges visible to node n for its current solve attempt.
VisibleGraph(n) == DynamicDeps(solve_count, n)

\* Minimum / Maximum of a nonempty set of naturals.
MinOfSet(S) == CHOOSE x \in S : \A y \in S : x <= y
MaxOfSet(S) == CHOOSE x \in S : \A y \in S : x >= y

\* Deterministic choice from a nonempty set of nodes.
\* In the real code this is min(CalcId); here we use CHOOSE which
\* is deterministic in TLC (always picks the same element for the
\* same set). The specific choice doesn't matter for correctness —
\* what matters is that it's deterministic and that invariant (c)
\* verifies all members get driven.
PickNode(S) == CHOOSE x \in S : TRUE

\* Remove entries at indices in `remove` from sequence `seq`.
\* Preserves the relative order of kept entries.

\* Reachability and ground-truth SCCs
\* ---------------------------------------------------------------

\* Transitive closure of FullGraph: Reachable(n) is the set of
\* nodes reachable from n via one or more edges in FullGraph.
\* Uses iterative fixpoint over the powerset.
Reachable(n) ==
    LET step(S) == S \union UNION {FullGraph[m] : m \in S}
        \* Iterate |Nodes| times — sufficient for transitive closure.

            IF i = 0 THEN FullGraph[n]
            ELSE step(iter[i-1])
    IN iter[Cardinality(Nodes)]

\* The true SCC of node n: all nodes mutually reachable with n
\* (including n itself) via FullGraph. Only nodes that form a
\* cycle are included — singleton nodes without self-loops are
\* not considered SCCs.
TrueScc(n) ==
    LET mutual == {m \in Nodes : n \in Reachable(m) /\ m \in Reachable(n)}
    IN  IF n \in Reachable(n) THEN mutual \union {n}

\* The set of all ground-truth SCCs (sets with >= 2 members, or
\* singletons with self-loops).

\* Everything on the stack is globally InProgress.
StackIsInProgress ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(stack) : state[stack[i]] = "InProgress"

\* A node that is globally Done has all deps (in FullGraph) Done.
\* Once committed, a node's answer must be valid against all
\* real dependencies.
DepsBeforeDone ==
    \A n \in Nodes :
        state[n] = "Done" =>
            \A dep \in FullGraph[n] : state[dep] = "Done"

\* SCC members are globally InProgress (never Done while SCC exists).

    \A i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) :
        \A n \in scc_stack[i].members :

\* No node appears in more than one SCC.

        \A j \in 1..Len(scc_stack) :
            i /= j => scc_stack[i].members \intersect scc_stack[j].members = {}

\* Every SCC on the scc_stack either has a live member on the calc
\* stack, or has no actively-computing members (all are SccDone or
\* SccFresh, in a transient state between phases or between DFS
\* runs within a fixpoint phase).

\* Every position in an SCC segment range is a live stack frame and
\* belongs to that SCC. This is the explicit segment-liveness check:
\* [bottom_pos_inclusive, top_pos_exclusive) must point to current,
\* owned stack frames (never stale/out-of-range positions).
SccSegmentRangeIsLive ==

            /\ pos \in 1..Len(stack)
            /\ stack[pos] \in scc_stack[i].members

\* SCC segments form a monotonic disjoint chain of half-open ranges:
\* [bottom_pos_inclusive, top_pos_exclusive).
\* Earlier SCC-stack entries (lower index) are above later ones on the
\* calc stack, so for i < j we require j.top <= i.bottom.

\* (a) No cross-SCC preliminary answer leakage.
\* If a node read preliminary answers (via placeholder or previous
\* answer), it must have read from exactly one SCC, and that SCC
\* must be the one the node belongs to.
\* A violation means a node consumed a preliminary answer from a
\* *different* SCC without being merged into it.

\* (b) Committed SCCs match ground truth.
\* At commit time (phase = MaxPhase, all members done), the SCC's
\* members should be exactly one of the ground-truth SCCs.
CommittedSccMatchesTruth ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) :
        scc_stack[i].phase = MaxPhase =>
            scc_stack[i].members \in TrueSccSets

\* (c) All answers available at commit.
\* When an SCC reaches MaxPhase and all members are SccDone with
\* none on the stack, every member must have a current answer.
AllAnswersAtCommit ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(scc_stack) :

            n \notin StackSet
        => scc_stack[i].curr_answers = scc_stack[i].members

\* (d) Demotion correctness: if an SCC reached phase >= 2, it must
\* have successfully completed phase 1, meaning all members produced
\* answers that became prev_answers. If a merge expanded membership
\* without resetting, prev_answers would be a strict subset of members.
