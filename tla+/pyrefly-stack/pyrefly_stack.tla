---- MODULE pyrefly_stack ----

\* Step 3b': Separate global state from SCC-local state.
\*
\* Global state (modeling Calculation cells): Fresh / InProgress / Done.
\* SCC-local state (modeling Scc.node_state): SccInProgress / SccDone.
\* This separation mirrors the implementation: global state lives in
\* Answers/Calculation, SCC state lives in thread-local Scc structs.
\* Merging only touches SCC records, not global state.

\* Cases:
